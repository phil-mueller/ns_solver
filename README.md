The purpose of this project is the development a Navier Stokes solver. The domain of interest is a channel flow with an 
obstacle. The 2D laminar Navier Stokes equations are discretized in time (standard predictor-corrector scheme) and in space 
(finite volume formulation). A co-located grid arrangement is used. To prevent the checkerboard effect, a disadvantage of 
this mesh type, the Rhie and Chow interpolation is implemented. Obstacles of various shapes can be included on the southern 
wall. The solver results were validate against literature data for channel flow up to a Reynolds number of Re=250.
